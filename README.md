# <img src="source/icon.png" width=32> Free Game Notifications Plugin
This plugin periodically checks the Epic Games Store for free games and gives you a notification when there's a free game to claim that you don't already own.  

Clicking the notification brings you to the game page so you can claim it.

## Todo
Eventually I would like to support checking other game stores.
